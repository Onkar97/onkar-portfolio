        This was before I joined Yardi Software India Private Limited as a Software Analyst, where my responsibilities included analysis of the software systems, optimization of the processes, and liaisoning with various teams to ensure software functionality and enhancement. My role required comprehensive troubleshooting, ensuring system stability, and supporting product improvements.

        Before Yardi, I was at Lifeline Systech Solutions, Pune, employed as a Software Engineer. Some of my major roles in this organization were to develop stored procedures, views, and triggers. I supported customers at the L1, L2, and L3 levels by working closely with the support team to troubleshoot and resolve the technical problems of clients. Additionally, I have been deploying software products as an implementation engineer and managing smooth integrations into customer environments. This also  included responsibility for detailed product documentation of critical importance, both internally and for customers.

        I did my BE in Information Technology from Pune Institute of Computer Technology in 2020. My time at PICT helped me lay a very strong foundation in software development and problem-solving skills.

        Furthermore, as a student during undergraduate studies, I served as an intern in the position of a Software Developer at both Lifeline Systech Solutions and Fuzen.io. These projects gave me hands-on exposure to the software development life cycle with strong enhancement of technical skills.
