        This was before I joined Yardi Software India Private Limited as a Associate Software Engineer, where my responsibilities included initiatives to improve performance and efficiency. I integrated structured logging with AWS CloudWatch, which reduced the mean time to resolution for over 600 high-priority production issues by 10%. Additionally, I designed a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that automated deployments for 10+ hotfixes, and I enhanced the front-end architecture with over 20 reusable React and Angular components, boosting application responsiveness by 15%.

        Before Yardi, I was at Lifeline Systech Solutions, Pune, employed as a Software Engineer. I focused on enhancing system reliability, successfully decreasing production deployment downtime by 12% by establishing a new CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins. I also accelerated issue resolution time by 10% through the implementation of a centralized logging dashboard using an AWS-hosted ELK stack.

        I did my BE in Information Technology from Pune Institute of Computer Technology in 2020. My time at PICT helped me lay a very strong foundation in software development and problem-solving skills.

        My career began with impactful internships where I honed my foundational skills. At Lifeline Systech Solutions, I developed a C# application that automated the migration of over 2 TB of data, reducing manual effort by 40 hours. During my time at Fuzen.io, I built a social media automation tool using Go and Ruby on Rails, which decreased the content team's manual workload by 25%.
